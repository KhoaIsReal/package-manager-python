# package-manager-python
My first personal project,hope you enjoy this!
# How to use that
first you need to clone that
you must install docker \n
next use .\build_image.bat to make a docker image \n
and .\run.bat \n
make a mysql connection on host and change the main.py to make it run with your connection
THAT'S SO
